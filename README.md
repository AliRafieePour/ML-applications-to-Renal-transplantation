# ML-applications-to-Renal-transplantation

Clinical datasets are commonly restricted in size, and access to them is difficult and expensive in many cases, thus using novel methodologies such as ML of particular
interest and application. Renal transplantation has become the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage renal disease. Given the recent progress in data analysis areas, optimizing transplantation outcomes has become of paramount importance to increase graft survival time and the patientsâ€™ quality of life. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms before and after transplantation for both the host and the graft would make the way for an improved prognosis. In this report, a valuable set of data collected from a hospital in Tehran, Iran, were examined and compared with multiple similar articles in the literature regarding the methodologies used and the outcomes. Since Iran faces constraints in the medical equipment compared to other nations in the world, some comparisons were not possible, and the study parameters were partially different from the approach others had. This report has examined common methodologies in the literature such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Decision Forests. It would recommend a ranking of features to facilitate and improve further analysis.
